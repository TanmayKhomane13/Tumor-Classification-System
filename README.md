ðŸ§  Tumor Classification â€“ Logistic Regression & CNN (X-ray)

This program implements two approaches for tumor classification:
- A logistic regression model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on numerical features such as tumor size, patient age, and tumor density.
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on X-ray images to classify tumors without relying on structured data.

The aim of this project is to explore and compare different approaches to medical image and feature-based classification, and to eventually integrate both types of inputs in a unified system.
