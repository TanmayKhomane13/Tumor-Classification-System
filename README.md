üß† Tumor Classification using CNN (X-ray Images)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for binary tumor classification using X-ray images. It predicts whether a tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0) using grayscale medical scans. The model is built from scratch using PyTorch and OpenCV, without using any pre-trained weights or external annotation tools.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Custom CNN architecture trained on X-ray images
- OpenCV-based preprocessing
- Binary classification with sigmoid output
- Helper functions for evaluating on test sets and predicting custom images
- No external annotations or pre-trained models used
